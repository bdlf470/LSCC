enomic Analysis of Coding and Non-Coding Drivers in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC)
ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains the code and data processing pipelines for the comprehensive genomic analysis presented in the study:
â€‹â€‹"Genomic landscape of somatic mutations in gene exons and promoters of lung squamous cell carcinoma"â€‹â€‹
The study identifies novel driver mutations in both protein-coding exons and non-coding promoter regions of LUSC, linking them to patient prognosis and key cancer pathways (e.g., Hippo, TGF-Î², NOTCH).  Functional validation reveals that a promoter mutation in WDR74enhances STAT3 binding, promoting oncogenesis.
